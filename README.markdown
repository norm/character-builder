D&D 5e character builder
========================

Create a text file that describes only the available features of a D&D
character at a given level, including when multiclassing.


Usage:

```
bash create.sh [number-of-levels] [class/subclass] ...

# start your perfect warlock
bash create.sh 1 warlock/hexblade

# multiclass her a little
bash create.sh 3 warlock/hexblade 3 sorcerer/shadow 2 warlock/hexblade

# or, see what a full straight class gives you
bash create.sh 20 cleric/order
```
