### Deflect Missiles

You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit
by a ranged weapon attack, reducing the damage by 1D10 plus your Dexterity
modifier plus your Monk level.

If the damage is reduced to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small
enough for you to hold in one hand, and you have a hand free. You can then
spend 1 Ki to make a ranged attack with the missile as part of the same
reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, and the missile counts as
a Monk weapon with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
