Hit Points = D8
Martial Arts die = D4

### Unarmored Defense

While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals
10 plus your Dexterity modifier plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use
unarmed strikes and Monk weapons (which are shortswords and simple melee
weapons that don't have the Heavy or Two-Handed property).

You gain the following benfits while you are unarmed or wielding only
Monk weapons and you aren't wearing Armor or wielding a Shield:

    Martial Arts die
        You can roll one Martial Arts die in place of the normal damage of
        your unarmed strike or Monk weapon. This die increases at future Monk
        levels.

    Dexterous Attack
        You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
        rolls of your unarmed strikes and Monk weapons.

    Bonus Attack
        When you use the Attack Action with an unarmed strike or a Monk weapon
        on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
