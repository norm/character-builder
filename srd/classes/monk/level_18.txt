### Empty Body

You can use your action to spend 4 Ki to become invisible for 1 minute. During
that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 Ki to cast Astral Projection without needing
material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with
you.
