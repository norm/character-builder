### Evasion

Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area
effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a Fireball spell. When
you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on
the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind

You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you
to be charmed or frightened.
