### Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you
hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 Ki to start these
imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk
level.

The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. In order
to do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you
use this action, the creature must make a Constition saving throw. If it fails
it is reduced to 0 hit points, otherwise it takes 10D10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You
can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
