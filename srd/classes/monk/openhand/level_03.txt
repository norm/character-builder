### Open Hand Technique

You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you hardness your own. Whenever you
hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows,
you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

  * It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
  * It must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away
    from you.
  * It cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn.
