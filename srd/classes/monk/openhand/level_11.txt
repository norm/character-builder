### Tranquility

You can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace.
At the end of a Long Rest, you gain the effect of a Sanctuary spell that lasts
until the start of your next Long Rest (you can choose to end the effect
early). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier
plus your Proficiency bonus.
