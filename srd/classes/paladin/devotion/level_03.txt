### Oath of Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a Paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,
virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy
warriors, these Paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting
with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to
the highest standards of conduct, and some for better or worse, hold the rest
of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to
gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their
devotion. They hold angels — the perfect servants of good — as their ideal,
and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, Paladins
of this oath share these tenets:

    Honesty
        Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.
    Courage
        Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
    Compassion
        Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them.
        Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.
    Honor
        Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example
        to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of
        harm.
    Duty
        Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those
        entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over
        you.

### Channel Divinity

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

    Sacred Weapon
        As an action you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with
        positive energy. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to
        attack rolls made with that weapon (+1 minimum). The weapon also emits
        bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If
        the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the
        duration.

        You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If
        you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
        unconscious, this effect ends.

    Turn the Unholy
        As an action you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
        fiends and undead. Each fiend or undead within 30 feet of you that can
        see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
        its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

        A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
        you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet
        of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only
        the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
        moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
        action.
