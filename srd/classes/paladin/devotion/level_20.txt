### Holy Nimbus

Once per Long Rest, as an action you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1
minute, bright light shines from you in a 30 foot radius, and dim light shines
30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature
takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
