Hit Dice = D10

### Divine Sense

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and
powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can
open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn,
you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you
that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or
undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (for
example, if the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich was near, you would only
know an undead creature). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as per the
Hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 plus your Charisma
modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that can
restore hit points equal to five times your Paladin level. It replenishes
when you finish a Long Rest.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore
a number of hit points to that creature up to the maximum amount remaining in
your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool to cure the target
of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands,
expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead or constructs.
