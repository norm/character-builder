### Divine Health

The divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

### Sacred Oath

You swear the oath that binds you as a Paladin forever. Up to this time you
have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn
to it.

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. 

### Oath Spells

Each oath has a list of associated spells. Once you gain access to an oath
spell you always have it prepared, and they do not count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. Even if any gained spell is not on the
Paladin spell list, it is nonetheless a Paladin spell for you.

### Channel Divinity

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy into magical effects. When you
use Channel Divinity, you must then finish a Short or Long Rest to use the
ability with any option again. Some options require saving throws, which is
against your Paladin spell save DC.
