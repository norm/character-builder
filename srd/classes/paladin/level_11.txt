### Continuous Smite

You are now so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon
strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee
weapon, the creature takes an extra 1D8 radiant damage. If you also use your
Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage from
Divine Smite.
