### Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations,
fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical
ability.

You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice, and more at later Warlock
levels. Additionally, when you gain a Warlock level, you can choose one of the
invocations you know and replace it with another invocation you can learn at
that level.
