### Otherworldly Patron

You have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice, 
the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One.

### Pact Magic

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given
you facility with spells.

    Cantrips
        You know two cantrips of your choice from the Warlock spell list.

    Spell Slots
        You gain spell slots, all of which are the same level which increases
        as you gain Warlock levels. To cast one of your Warlock spells of
        1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
        Warlock spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

    Spells Known
        You choose spells from the Warlock spell list. A spell you choose must
        be of a level equal or lower than the Warlock spell slots available.
        When you gain a Warlock level, you can choose one Warlock spell you
        know and replace it with another from the Warlock spell list, which
        can be a higher level than the replaced spell but still no higher than
        that of your Warlock spell slots.

    Spellcasting
        Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.
        You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
        Warlock spells.
