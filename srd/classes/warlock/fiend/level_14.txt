### Hurl Through Hell

Once per Long Rest, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can instantly
transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and
hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously
occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it
takes 10D10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
