### Spellcasting

have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much 
as a druid does.

#### Spell Slots

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Spells Known

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Ranger spell list.
At higher levels you learn more spells. Each of these spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally,
when you gain a level in this class you can choose one of the Ranger spells
you know and replace it with another spell from the Ranger spell list, which
must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells, since your magic
draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisom whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisom modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a Ranger spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

    Spell save DC = 8 plus your Proficiency bonus plus your Wisdom modifier
    Spell attack modifier = your Proficiency bonus plus your Wisdom modifier
