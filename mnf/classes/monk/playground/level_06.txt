### Dislocator

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your 
Flurry of Blows, you can spend 1 Ki to grab them and throw them into the
space behind you.

  * It takes 1D6 extra Force damage.
  * It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

If there is an obstacle (wall, another creature) that stops it from entering
that space, you instead switch places (this does not provoke opportunity
attacks). If there is a drop behind you, the creature falls according to
normal rules.
